## Introduction

Open Builder is a desktop-first AI web app generator with a browser-compatible interface. Simply describe the application you want to build in natural language, and the AI will create, modify, and delete files in an in-memory file system through a Tool Call loop, with live preview powered by [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/).

Open Builder does not require a hosted application backend. The Web app connects directly to the providers and approved remote tools you configure; provider settings, including API keys, are stored in browser local storage and are sent only when required by those configured services.

The Tauri desktop build (macOS / Windows / Linux) provides local runtime capabilities such as stdio MCP. Web and experimental mobile builds intentionally omit local process and Skill script execution.

> Native adapters are included for OpenAI Responses, Anthropic, and Google, plus OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as Ollama and other compatible gateways.

## Features

### Core

- **Natural Language to Code** — Describe your idea, AI plans and generates the complete project structure
- **Live Preview** — Browser-based sandbox powered by Sandpack, instant rendering on code changes
- **Multi-Framework Support** — 20+ templates including React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, SolidJS, and Astro, with Open Builder-managed dependency profiles and verified Sandpack/Nodebox runtime locks
- **Smart File Operations** — AI uses `patch_file` for precise modifications, avoiding unnecessary full rewrites
- **Dependency Management** — AI can modify `package.json` and trigger dependency reinstallation
- **Build Accelerators** — Install shadcn components, translate screenshots into components, apply design specifications, and manage typed environment schemas through dedicated tools
- **Project Guidance** — Root-level `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `DESIGN.md` files can guide generation while remaining untrusted project data that cannot override tool or safety policy
- **Project Snapshots** — Browse snapshot history, name snapshots, inspect diffs, export patches, and roll back to historical versions
- **Project Health Check** — Run `/health` to inspect structure, dependencies, runtime logs, accessibility, and responsive risks; isolated Automatic QA performs a restricted project check without MCP or preview-console access
- **Context Compression** — Use `/compact` or the command palette to summarize long conversations and reduce token usage
- **Plan Mode** — Explore the code and submit an implementation plan for approval before writing files; `ask_user_question` supports both independent clarification batches and one-question-at-a-time stress-test interviews
- **Subagent Collaboration** — Built-in read-only subagents for code exploration, review, dependency advice, bug investigation, and UI critique
- **Built-in Search** — Supports enabling the model's built-in search service
- **Desktop API Proxy** — Tauri can forward approved HTTP/HTTPS provider requests that would otherwise be blocked by browser CORS; static Web deployments still depend on provider CORS support
- **Desktop Local CLI Runtime** — Explicitly run the complete generation workflow through a signed-in Codex CLI while keeping API mode as the default; the Claude adapter remains fail-closed until its CLI exposes compatible pre-input isolation

### User Experience

- **Multi-Session Management** — Sidebar with create, switch, delete sessions; history persisted locally
- **Session Organization** — Search, pin, archive, fork, and smart-rename conversations
- **Project Templates** — Save generated projects as reusable local templates and start new sessions from them
- **Smart Session Naming** — Auto-generates session titles based on conversation content
- **Slash Commands** — Input box supports `/new`, `/fork`, `/clear`, `/reset`, `/compact`, `/health`, `/review`, `/continue`, and `/retry`
- **Command Palette & Shortcuts** — Open commands with `Cmd/Ctrl+K`, create sessions, open settings, focus input, or stop generation from the keyboard
- **Image & File Input** — Upload screenshots, text files, or PDFs; PDF-capable models receive PDFs as native file input without local text extraction
- **Skills System** — Enabled Skills expose metadata for automatic discovery; full instructions load only after `read_skill` or when a Skill is selected for the next message, which also applies to subagents and clears after sending. Built-ins include `design-taste-frontend`, `frontend-design`, `code-review`, and `code-simplifier`; imported Skills start with discovery disabled
- **Custom Instructions** — Advanced settings can safely append up to 32,000 characters to Chat, Plan, retry, and subagent requests without granting tools or changing mode restrictions; utility calls such as Automatic QA, titles, and compression exclude them
- **Local Settings** — Provider configuration, API keys, and custom instructions persist in browser local storage
- **Storage Governance** — Inspect local data usage and safely clean archived sessions, empty sessions, and old snapshots
- **Streaming Output** — Real-time display of AI thinking process and code generation progress
- **Extended Thinking** — Supports Extended Thinking / Reasoning mode (DeepSeek-R1, Claude 4.6, etc.)
- **One-Click Download** — Export generated project as a ZIP file
- **Workspace Tools** — Switch between code and preview, search and manage files, inspect the Sandpack console, and preview desktop/tablet/phone widths with fit and zoom controls
- **Adaptive Layout** — Desktop uses a horizontal resizable split, tablets use a vertical resizable workspace-over-chat split, and phones use a chat-first layout with inline preview
- **Languages & Themes** — English and Simplified Chinese interfaces with system, light, and dark themes

### MCP and Platform Capabilities (Optional)

- Configure remote HTTPS MCP servers with Streamable HTTP or SSE, static headers, OAuth authorization code, or OAuth client credentials; desktop builds also support stdio servers.
- Import server definitions from JSON, enable servers and tools independently, and review tool-definition drift before changed capabilities can run.
- Plan Mode and subagents receive only MCP tools explicitly approved as read-only for those modes.

| Runtime             | Remote HTTPS MCP | stdio MCP | Skill scripts                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Web                 | Yes              | No        | No                                   |
| Desktop             | Yes              | Yes       | Developer switch + per-call approval |
| Experimental mobile | Yes              | No        | No                                   |

### Web Search

- [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) is the default for new or reset settings and supports keyless search and page reading under IP-based limits; an optional API key raises those limits
- [Tavily](https://tavily.com) and [Exa](https://exa.ai) are available with provider credentials; supported model providers can also use built-in search
- Web content reading automatically falls back to [Jina Reader](https://jina.ai/reader/) when a configured reader cannot return a page

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS
- pnpm 11
- A supported provider endpoint and an API key when that provider requires one

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amery2010/open-builder.git
cd open-builder

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser, click the settings icon in the top-right corner to configure your API Key.

### Desktop / Mobile App (Tauri)

Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Tauri [platform dependencies](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

```bash
# Desktop development
pnpm tauri:dev

# Desktop build
pnpm tauri:build

# iOS development / build
pnpm tauri ios init # first setup only
pnpm tauri:ios:dev
pnpm tauri:ios:build

# Android development / build
pnpm tauri android init # first setup only
pnpm tauri:android:dev
pnpm tauri:android:build
```

### Local CLI Runtime (Desktop)

The desktop app can use an installed Codex CLI as a complete agent runtime. API mode remains the default and Open Builder never silently falls back between runtimes. The Claude adapter is included, but current Claude CLI releases are reported as **Unsupported** because they cannot prove isolation before receiving user content while also retaining both the Open Builder MCP bridge and subscription authentication.

1. Install the official Codex CLI and sign in with `codex login`.
2. Start the desktop app and open **Settings → Model → Runtime → Local CLI**.
3. Select Codex. Open Builder scans `PATH` and common installation locations; **Choose program** can store a validated executable override in native app data. Claude remains visible for capability diagnostics but cannot start a turn until a compatible CLI protocol is available.
4. Confirm that the status is **Installed and signed in**, then optionally select a model and reasoning effort reported by the CLI.

The local CLI is not an offline model. Prompts, attachments, web-search activity, and tool results are normally sent to the selected provider and may consume account subscription or usage quota. Open Builder checks login status but does not read, copy, or persist CLI credentials.

Projects remain in Open Builder's in-memory virtual file system. The CLI runs in an isolated empty directory and can interact with the project only through the per-run loopback MCP bridge. Attachment IDs are opaque; host file paths are not exposed. Provider configuration, hooks, unrelated MCP servers, shell tools, and CLI project-instruction injection are rejected or disabled before user content is sent.

When Web Search is **Model Built-in**, local mode uses the selected CLI's native search. Tavily, Firecrawl, or Exa selections instead use the existing Open Builder tools and keep native search disabled. If detection reports not installed, signed out, unsupported, or an isolation error, use **Rescan**, **Choose program**, **Use auto-detection**, or copy the displayed login command. Web and mobile builds show a blocking message and require switching back to API.

### Configuration

Click the settings button in the top-right corner and fill in:

| Option              | Description                                   | Example                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| API Type            | Provider protocol adapter                     | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, compatible |
| API Key             | Provider credential, when required            | `sk-...`                              |
| API Base URL        | Provider origin or base path                  | `https://api.openai.com`              |
| Model Name          | Model ID; supported providers can list models | `gpt-5.6-sol`, `deepseek-chat`        |
| Web Search          | Keyless Firecrawl, or provider credentials    | `fc-...`, `tvly-...`, or an Exa key   |
| Image Search        | Optional Pixabay or Unsplash credential       | Provider API key                      |
| Custom Instructions | Reusable instructions under Advanced settings | Up to 32,000 characters               |

> Settings and API keys are stored in browser local storage. Custom instructions are sent to the selected model provider for Chat, Plan, retry, and subagent work. They cannot expand tool permissions; do not place credentials or other secrets in them. Treat the browser profile and device as part of your credential security boundary.

MCP servers and Skills are managed from the chat toolbar. A Skills management switch controls metadata auto-discovery only. Selecting a Skill in the toolbar loads its full instructions for the next request and then clears the selection. Desktop-only options are shown only when the native runtime reports the required capability.

## Supported API Protocols

Open Builder selects a native AI SDK adapter from the configured API Type and can query supported provider endpoints for their model list.

| API Type          | Protocol/adapter           | Default base URL                            | Typical use                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| OpenAI Compatible | OpenAI-compatible chat API | `http://localhost:11434`                    | Ollama and compatible gateways |
| OpenAI            | Responses API              | `https://api.openai.com`                    | OpenAI                         |
| Anthropic         | Messages API               | `https://api.anthropic.com`                 | Anthropic                      |
| Google            | Generative Language API    | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | Google Gemini                  |

> For best results, use a model with strong Function Calling support.

---

## Deployment

Static Web deployments do not include the Tauri API proxy, stdio MCP, or Skill script execution. Model and search endpoints used directly from a browser must allow the deployment origin through CORS.

### Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
# Output to dist/ directory

### Docker / GitHub Container Registry

The lightweight container image serves the Web build with an unprivileged Nginx Alpine runtime:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/amery2010/open-builder:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. It intentionally contains no provider credentials, API proxy, stdio MCP, Local CLI, or Skill script runtime; browser-facing provider and search endpoints must allow the deployed origin through CORS.

Pushing a semantic version tag such as `v1.8.0` runs the frontend quality gates and a container smoke test before publishing `1.8.0`, `1.8`, `1`, and `latest` tags to `ghcr.io/amery2010/open-builder`. Pre-release tags publish only their full pre-release version. GitHub initializes a new container package as private, so a repository owner must change its visibility to public once after the first successful publish.

See [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml).

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Actions builds and deploys Pages when `main` is updated (or when the workflow is started manually). The workflow sets Vite's base path to the repository subpath, including the static MCP OAuth callback entry. A `v*` tag creates a draft desktop release and publishes the container image after their respective quality gates pass; it does not deploy Pages.

See [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
