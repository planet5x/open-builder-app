## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management)
- pnpm 11
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/open-builder.git
cd open-builder

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and enter your API Key in settings to start debugging.

### Available Commands

```bash
pnpm dev               # Start the Vite dev server
pnpm build             # Build for production
pnpm build:check       # Verify production artifact budgets
pnpm preview           # Preview the production build
pnpm typecheck         # TypeScript type checking
pnpm lint              # ESLint with zero warnings
pnpm format:check      # Prettier verification, including documentation
pnpm version:check     # Package/Cargo/Tauri/in-app version contract
pnpm version:sync      # Write package.json version to the other version files
pnpm workflow:check    # GitHub Actions and release-workflow contract
pnpm test              # Unit tests
pnpm test:components   # Component-level Vitest tests
pnpm security:desktop  # Desktop capability and security policy checks
```

## Project Structure

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the core modules:

```
src/
├── lib/ai/generator.ts   # Core engine: WebAppGenerator (Tool Call loop)
├── lib/tools/            # Built-in project and network tools
├── lib/mcp/              # MCP validation, transports, and runtime policy
├── lib/skills/           # Skill storage, import, activation, and execution policy
├── lib/attachments/      # Blob-backed attachment persistence
├── lib/security/         # Permission activity and native execution revocation
├── store/settings/       # Settings persistence
├── store/conversation.ts # Zustand session state management
├── hooks/useGenerator.ts # Hook connecting engine to UI
└── components/           # UI components
```

**Exercise caution** when modifying the core engine (`generator.ts`) — it directly affects AI tool call stability.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-123
   ```

2. **Develop and commit**

   Keep each commit focused on a single change and follow the commit convention.

3. **Ensure code quality**

   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm lint
   pnpm format:check
   pnpm version:check
   pnpm workflow:check
   pnpm test
   pnpm test:components
   pnpm security:desktop
   pnpm build
   pnpm build:check

   cd src-tauri
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   cargo test
   ```

4. **Push and create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

   Create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
   - A brief description of the changes
   - Related Issue (if any)
   - Testing method

5. **Wait for review**

   Maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible. Please be patient and address feedback accordingly.

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one PR per concern
- Ensure your PR is based on the latest `main` branch (rebase if there are conflicts)
- Do not include unrelated formatting changes in the PR
- Update both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` when user-facing behavior changes
- Add user-visible changes to the `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript; avoid `any` (add a comment explaining the reason if necessary)
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- File naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utility functions
- Keep code concise and avoid over-abstraction
- When adding a tool, define its capability in `src/lib/ai/tools-schema.ts`; schema visibility and execution authorization must derive from the same policy

---

## Versioning and Release Notes

`package.json` is the version source of truth. After intentionally changing it, run `pnpm version:sync` and verify with `pnpm version:check`. Do not edit Cargo, Tauri, or the in-app version independently.

Keep `CHANGELOG.md` in reverse chronological order under `Unreleased`. A `v*` tag triggers the desktop draft-release workflow only after the frontend and Rust quality gates pass; Pages deployment remains tied to `main` or a manual workflow run.
